# Advanced To-Do-List application

In this To-do application you can create your list of things to do and it will be saved on the localstorage for later use aswell. 
All the To-do's will be shown in an list, with the date on which it was created, you can play your text outloud by clicking the speaker icon, you can overcheck the 
created To-do list values and aswell undo the overcheck, you can also permanently delete the ones you want. All of these actions will be saved on the localstorage automatically,
so next time you come back it will be just the way you left it.
