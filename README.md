# Advanced To-Do-List application

In this To-do application you can create your list of things to do and it will be saved on the localstorage for later use aswell.  
All the To-do's will be shown in an list, with the date and time on which it was created, <br />
* You can play your text outloud by clicking the speaker icon, <br />
* You can overcheck the created To-do list values and aswell undo the overcheck. <br />
* You can delete the ones you want. <br />

All of these actions will be saved on the localstorage automatically.<br />
